    "In the ancient land of Alteria, a realm once divided among humans, elves, goblinoids (known as \"beasts\"), and dragons, peace was a fleeting dream. Fifty years before the great conflict that would shape the future, the elves and humans had driven the beasts and dragons into the Dark Mountains. With their common enemies vanquished, the two once-allied races soon turned against each other, unaware that darkness was growing stronger in the very mountains they thought were subdued. The Black Dragon Karas, bound by a gem of dark power embedded in his chest, was stirring once more, rallying the beasts into a formidable army.\n",

    "Lambert, a spirited and adventurous young human, lived a carefree life with his loyal dogs, One and Two. His world is turned upside down when he encounters a marauding band of beasts. Just as Lambert and his dogs are about to meet a grim fate, they are rescued by a trio of legendary adventurers: Barnac, the daring captain of a flying ship; Geraint, the renowned dragon fighter; and Argenta, Geraint’s fierce sister. Their rescue leads them to the human kingdom of Saint Heaven, where Lambert’s path intersects with that of Liya, a brave Elven maiden. Liya, along with her companion, Princess Nerwin, has come to plead with the king for an alliance against the looming beast threat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amidst Lambert’s attempts to secure a sword and prove his worth, he joins forces with Liya and the heroic trio to repel a beast attack on the city. Their valiant efforts persuade the wary king to agree to the alliance, a crucial step in confronting the growing menace.\n",

A lightning storm causes the ship to crash, forcing the group to continue their quest on foot. They traverse haunted ruins and face beastly scouts, all while Lambert and Liya's bond deepens.
